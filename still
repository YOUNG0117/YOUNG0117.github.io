第一节
Two roads diverged1 in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent2 in the undergrowth3.

Then took the other, as just as fair4,
And having perhaps the better claim5,
Because it was grassy6 and wanted wear7;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn8 them really about the same.
第三节
And both that morning equally9 lay
In leaves no step had trodden10 black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.
第四节
I shall be telling this with a sigh11
Somewhere ages12 and ages hence13:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I--
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.
